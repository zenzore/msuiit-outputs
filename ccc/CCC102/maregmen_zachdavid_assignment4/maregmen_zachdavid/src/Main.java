 *     This program is a Graphical User Interface that will convert any number system to
 *     any number system.

 *     Window is separated from this file and also the number methods to provide cleanness
 *     of the code.

 *     Normally I would code with many warnings and typos, but thanks to JetBrains Intellij,
 *     I used refactoring features and typo analyzers.

 *     References: <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/">...</a>
 *     ^ this link helped me finish the conversion methods.
